# Why Do We Test Software?

## Software Faults, Errors & Failures

Software Fault 
: A static defect in the software

Software Failure 
: External, incorrect behavior with respect to the requirements or other description of the expected behavior

Software Error 
: An incorrect internal state that is the manifestation of some fault

Faults in software are equivalent to design mistakes in hardware. Software does not degrade

## Validation & Verification (IEEE)

Validation 
: The process of evaluating software at the end
of software development to ensure compliance with
intended usage

Verification 
: The process of determining whether the
products of a given phase of the software development process fulfill the requirements established during the previous phase
