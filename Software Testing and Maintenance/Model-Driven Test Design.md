# Model-Driven Test Design

## Testing & Debugging
Testing:
Evaluating software by observing its execution

Test Failure:
Execution of a test that results in a software failure

Debugging:
The process of finding a fault given a failure

## Fault & Failure Model (RIPR)
Reachability:
The location or locations in the program that contain the fault must be reached

Infection: 
The state of the program must be incorrect

Propagation:
The infected state must cause some output or final state of the program to be incorrect

Reveal:
The tester must observe part of the incorrect portion of the program state
